### Project Title
Explore Bikeshare Data using R

### Description
In this project, R is used to explore data related to bike sharing system for three major cities in United States:
New York City, Washington and Chicago.

Exploratory data analysis has been conducted on these datasets by the use of descriptive statistics and visualizations to explain below queries:

1. Count of user types and their total travel Time
2. Count of users in different user types and their average travel time
3. Total and average travel time based on gender

### Files used
The data used in this project has been provided by Motivate, a bike sharing system provider for many cities in United States. The dataset is provided for three large cities of New York, Washington and Chicago.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same six columns:

1. Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
2. End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
3. Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
4. Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
5. End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
6. User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

1. Gender
2. Birth Year
